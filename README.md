Our first year CFM course at the University of Waterloo concluded with a portfolio-generation competition. Teams of three first-year CFM students coded portfolio-geneation applications in Python, selecting portfolios dynamically from an unknown list of stocks while meeting stringent admissibility criteria given out by Professor Thompson.



We are proud to present our winning code that demonstrates our innovative drive and technical expertise in the fintech field.

Our code has generated a portfolio that has produced the best results in the history of the Computing and Financial Management Program!
